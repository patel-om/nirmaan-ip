"""The tool catalog: capability-based permissions over honest implementations.

``AVAILABLE`` means a real binding exists in this repository and an
invocation executes. ``CONTRACT_ONLY`` means the organization plans around the
tool but nothing here can run it, and the broker refuses rather than pretends:
no agent can ever claim a CDC or equivalence run happened.

Lint, simulation, tests, synthesis, and formal are AVAILABLE through
open-source EDA (``nirmaan/integrations/eda.py``, M21); static timing and
place and route through OpenSTA and OpenROAD (``integrations/physical.py``,
M25), and physical verification through KLayout (M34). Their bindings still refuse, with a reason, on a machine whose PATH
lacks the executable or that has no PDK input for the run. Firmware build and
co-simulation are AVAILABLE the same way (``nirmaan/integrations/firmware.py``,
M25), and so are the RV32I cross build and the run on a RISC-V core
(``nirmaan/integrations/firmware_riscv.py``, M27).

Scan insertion, DFT rule checks, and scan chain simulation are AVAILABLE through
Yosys and Icarus (``nirmaan/integrations/dft.py``, M25); so are stuck-at ATPG,
graded by fault simulation, and March C- memory BIST (M27), and transition
ATPG (M29).

Every tool with a binding declares its parameters (M28): the broker refuses an
undeclared or ill-typed one before anything runs. The lists below are what the
bindings and backends actually read.
