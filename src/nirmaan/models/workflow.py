"""Workflow and requirement-analysis vocabulary.

A workflow is a reusable engineering process (new IP, RTL change, timing
closure), declared as stages with dependencies, conditions, branches, review
requirements, and gates. The orchestrator instantiates one into a task graph;
nothing in it names a department or a person, only capabilities.
