"""Model-backed runtimes (M20): a language model in a seat, checked rather than trusted.

:class:`ModelRuntime` is one class for every seat. Its behaviour comes from the
work packet, never from a role, skill, or stage name:

* before the model is asked, it runs the tools the task's evidence
  requirements name (when the seat is granted them), with parameters from the
  task's ``input.*`` memory entries, so the model can cite real runs;
* it renders the packet's four scopes into a :class:`WorkPrompt` and asks an
  :class:`LLM`;
* it strips every citation the prompt did not declare (M17 grounding, through
  the bridge), drops artifacts left with no citation, and passes the tool runs
  the model says it relied on to the engine unfiltered, where P5 judges them;
* files in the answer (M23) are written with a digest, and the tools of any
  evidence requirement over the task's own files run on them afterwards (with
  any approved upstream file the requirement names, M25). When such a check
  must pass before review and cannot run here, the work is blocked.

Two LLMs ship. :class:`RegistryLLM` reaches any provider in the one M17
registry through the bridge. :class:`MockLLM` is deterministic and scriptable,
so no test ever calls an API. The model-backed seats are off by default:
``unbound`` stays the default runtime.
