"""Test helpers for IP Nirmaan: drive a project forward the honest way.

``drive`` moves tasks through the engine exactly as people would: owners start
and submit, independent reviewers review, authorized approvers approve, gate
owners (as humans when a gate requires it) sign off. Evidence is attached only
in forms the engine can substantiate: human attestations, the task's own
document artifact, or a real VeriTriage run. Nothing is faked, so a project
that completes under ``drive`` completed under the real rules.

A task with before-review checks (M23, M26, M27) is worked in the gated order:
real files are written, every check runs for real over them through the
broker, and only then is the work submitted. Driving such a task needs the
EDA tools on PATH.

M38: a requirements spec is a real, tagged file, and a verification plan is a
real plan file checked against it, so a checked plan stage passes its check
for real and is recorded on approval.
