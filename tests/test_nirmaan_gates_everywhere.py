"""Milestone 27: the design gates on every RTL workflow, and proofs that are not vacuous.

The RTL stages of ``new-ip``, ``feature-addition``, and ``rtl-change`` now
carry the same before-review checks as ``block-design``: approved inputs only,
real lint and simulation, synthesis with no latches, and, when the seat writes
a ``.sby``, a proof that passes and a cover run that reaches every cover under
the same assumptions. All of it is data on the stages. Real-tool tests skip
when an executable is absent, or fail when CI names it in NIRMAAN_REQUIRE_EDA.
